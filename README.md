# five words

## background

How fast can I find all 5 word lists, where each list does not contain any duplicate letters (25 unique letters)?

Based on question posed in this video: [Someone improved my code by 40,832,277,770%](Someone improved my code by 40,832,277,770%) by Stand-up Maths

Some has done it in 6.5 microseconds (vs. the OP's > 1 month!). I'll be happy with < 1 minute.
